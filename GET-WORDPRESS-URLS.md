   - Blog? (yes/no)

## Why I Need This

I need to create 301 redirects from your old WordPress URLs to your new static site URLs.

**Example:**
```
Old WordPress: https://onlinetranslation.ae/about-us/
New Static:    https://onlinetranslation.ae/
Redirect:      301 permanent redirect
```

Without knowing your WordPress URLs, I'll create generic redirects that might miss some pages.

---

## Quick Start Option

**If you can't get the URLs right now**, I can:

1. ✅ Create the 4 hub pages now
2. ✅ Set up basic redirects (home, about, contact, services)
3. ⏭️ Add specific redirects later when you get the URL list

**This way we don't block progress.**

**Let me know and I'll help you through it!**
