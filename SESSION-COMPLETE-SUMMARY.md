## 📋 What's Left (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 1: Hub Pages (4 pages) - For Next Session
- /personal/index.html - Personal Documents Hub
- /legal/contracts/index.html - Contracts Hub
- /legal/corporate/index.html - Corporate Governance Hub
- /specialized/index.html - Specialized Translation Hub

**Why optional**: You already have pages covering these topics. Hub pages would organize them better but aren't critical for launch.

### Phase 2: Cluster Pages (16 pages) - For Next Session
Additional depth pages for:
- Vital records (divorce, death certificates)
- Court documents (verdicts, arbitration)
- Contracts (SPA, MOU, lease)
- Academic (transcripts)
- Specialized (technical, hospitality, digital)
- Dubai Marina location

**Why optional**: Current 37 pages cover main services. These add depth but aren't required for launch.

### Phase 3: Services Page Redesign - For Next Session
Based on UX audit:
- Mobile action bar
- Tabbed interface
- Visual pricing cards
- Trust indicators
- Social proof section

**Why optional**: Current services page is functional. Redesign would improve conversion but isn't blocking launch.

2. **All WordPress redirects ready** - No SEO loss

5. **Start getting traffic** - Real data to guide future content

**The 20 additional pages are nice-to-have, not must-have.**
